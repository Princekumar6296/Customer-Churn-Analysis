# Customer-Churn-Analysis

**📊 Executive Summary:** Telco Customer Churn Analysis
This analysis explores the key patterns behind customer churn using the Telco dataset, identifying critical factors that impact customer retention and suggesting actionable insights.

**🔍 Dataset Overview:**
The dataset includes demographic, contractual, and service usage data for telecom customers.

Variables analyzed include tenure, contract type, payment methods, technical service usage, and customer demographics (e.g., gender, senior citizen status, partner/dependents).

**📉 Churn Insights:**
Overall churn rate: Approximately 26.5% of customers have churned, indicating significant room for retention improvement.

1. Senior Citizens and Churn
Senior citizens exhibit a higher churn rate compared to non-seniors.

While senior citizens make up 16% of the customer base, they represent around 25% of churned customers — highlighting them as a vulnerable group.

2. Tenure Impact
Churn is highest in the first 3 months. Over 50% of churned customers had tenure less than 6 months.

Customers with longer tenure (> 24 months) are significantly more loyal — less than 5% churn rate in this segment.

Early engagement and onboarding efforts could play a vital role in retention.

3. Contract Type
Month-to-month contracts are the most common and most risky: over 43% churn rate in this category.

Customers on one- or two-year contracts churn much less, around 10% or lower, suggesting commitment reduces churn.

Incentives for longer contracts could reduce churn significantly.

4. Payment Method
Electronic checks are linked to higher churn (about 34% churn rate) compared to other methods (e.g., credit card: ~15%, bank transfer: ~12%).

Consider targeting these customers with retention campaigns or alternative payment method offers.

5. Service Usage Patterns
Lack of value-added services (e.g., tech support, online security) correlates with higher churn:

Customers without Online Security have a churn rate >30%.

Those with Online Security or Tech Support drop below 15% churn.

Upselling these services may improve stickiness.
